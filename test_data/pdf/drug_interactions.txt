IMPORTANT DRUG INTERACTIONS TO MONITOR

This guide provides information on significant medication interactions that require clinical attention.

BETA BLOCKERS AND ANTIDIABETICS
Patients taking atenolol (e.g., Tenormin) and diabetes medications like metformin should be monitored closely. Dr. Wong from Central Hospital notes that atenolol can mask hypoglycemia symptoms in diabetic patients, creating a dangerous situation if not properly managed. Recent cases at Central have shown this interaction in elderly patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

NSAID CONSIDERATIONS
Ibuprofen (such as Advil) should be used with caution in patients with hypertension, as it may decrease the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications including beta blockers. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is often a safer alternative for pain management in these patients.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR ASTHMA PATIENTS
Patients with asthma should avoid non-selective beta blockers. Albuterol (Proventil) remains the rescue medication of choice for these patients. Dr. M. Stevens from Riverside emphasizes the importance of having an asthma action plan.

Reference patient case studies are available in the clinical database under identifiers P-003 and P-004.
